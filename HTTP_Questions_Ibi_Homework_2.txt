HTTP
- What is port 443?
To start simply, a network port is used to direct traffic to the right places (helps devices involved identify
which service is being requested). Port 443 is used for secure transfers and is the standard port for HTTPS traffic,
though in cases where the site uses HTTPS  but is unavailable over port 443, port 80 can step in to load the HTTPS-enabled website
Fun Fact: >95% of requests over Chrome served using an HTTPS connection via port 443
- Which is preferred 80 or 443? Port 80 and Port 443 differ through security. Port-443 allows data to be transmitted over a secured network, whilst port 80
enables data transmission in plain text. For secure data t ransmission, Port-443 is preferred.
- Describe the following error codes:
    - 4xx: Client error codes which indicate that there is a problem with the request itself
    - 2xx: Success code, returned when a browser request is received, understood and processed by the server
    - 3xx: A redirection code return, so where a resource has been replaced/substituted with another, and that substitution is what the user is shown
    - 1xx: Informational codes, they indicate that the request initiated by the browser is continuing
    - 5xx: Server error codes, these indicate that the request was accepted, but an error on the server prevented the fulfilment of the request0
    - 301: a HTTP status code signalling a permanent redirect from one URL to another, i.e. when a page/website has been permanently moved or removed from a website
    - 403 (good description): A HTTP status code which means that the server understood the request but will not process it for some reason, usually a lack of permissions. 
    - 401 (good description): A HTTP status code which indicates that the request has not been applied as the user lacks valid authentication credentials.
    - 201: A HTTP status code which indicates that the request has succeeded and has led to the creation of a resource
    - 202: A HTTP status code which indicates that the request has been accepted for processing, but the processing hasn't completed yet (or may not have even begun processing)
