1). create a list of 5 fruits (make sure apple is one of them)
    - loop through the list and find apple

2). create another list of 5 brands, make sure the letter p isn't used

3). create a function (does_it_have_p) that accepts a list as a single argument:
    - The function should return a boolean value based on if an element of a list contains the letter 'p' (HINT: google on how to check if sub_string is in string)

4). You are a senior solutions architect for all Bulgarian night clubs. The customers of these clubs have been
reporting that underage people enter the club. You have been hired to develop a Python application that will 
accept your age and your name. Entry age should be 21. If you are below the age of 21 you shouldn't be allowed to enter.
In you are underage, you should be redirected to school.
